  <p>Yakada Labs is a software development partner that builds production grade custom AI systems. We integrate AI development with over two decades of experience in engineering highly available, scalable cloud platforms for Fortune 500 companies.</p>
  <p>In Sinhala, 'Yakada' (යකඩ) means iron. But iron is more than just a strong material; it is a material that is forged. It can be heated, hammered, and shaped into the specific tool needed for a precise job.</p>

  <p>This is our philosophy. We take the raw power of artificial intelligence and forge it. We don't offer one-size-fits-all products; we build custom AI solutions, meticulously shaped to meet the unique challenges and goals of each client. We deliver tools that are not only powerful but purposeful, durable, and a perfect fit.</p>

  <h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
  <p>These are the core principles of the company. We will use these principles to guide our work, collaborations, and day to day life in the company.</p>
  <h3>Focus on the customer</h3>
  <p>We are in the service business, we will help our customers better serve their customers. We build relationships with our customers based on trust. We will measure our success by our customers' outcomes. We have a long-term view of customer relationships. We are creating partnerships for decades, not for one project.</p>
  <h3>Be Reliable</h3>
  <p>In every way be reliable. Every day work to improve your "say-do" ratio, where your actions match with your words. Be a reliable teammate. If your team expects you to deliver something, do it before the agreed-upon deadline. Take ownership of your work; make sure it is complete. Don't let someone else find gaps in your work. If you can't keep a commitment you already made, be proactive in your communication.</p>
  <p>Close the open loops. If you are responsible for following up on something, make sure to see it through to completion. Don't blame others for not responding to you.</p>
  <h3>Communicate Clearly</h3>
  <p>Communicate with everyone clearly and set expectations accordingly. If you have made a commitment and you realize that you can't complete it on time, communicate that to everyone involved. Ask for help when you need it.</p>
  <p>Practice active listening; paraphrase to verify your understanding is correct.</p>
  <p>Pick the right medium for communication. Agree with your team on the expectations for response time. For example: email, I can wait a day to get a response, but I need an immediate response for a text message.</p>
  <p>When you communicate with your team, as a leader, make sure to give the team context and objectives. After that, make sure they have autonomy to achieve the objective. When you communicate clearly and give context, there is no need to micromanage your team.</p>
  <h3>Be Curious</h3>
  <p>In everything you do, be curious and have a beginner's mind. Don't take anything for granted and ask questions about things that are unclear.</p>
  <p>Ask five whys to get to the root of the problem.</p>
  <p>Be open to being wrong about things. That way you can learn the right things. Don't take it personally when you are wrong.</p>
  <p>Figure out the process of reaching an answer, so next time you can apply it yourself.</p>
  <h3>Seek the Truth</h3>
  <p>In every situation strive to seek the truth. It may not be what you want to hear, or what you want to see. But seeking the truth will help us get the most fundamental feedback needed for improvement. Don't stop the discussions because they are uncomfortable; keep pushing to seek the truth.</p>
  <p>Separate ideas from the person. The best solution or best course of action can come from anyone. Make sure to arrive at the best path regardless of who it came from.</p>
  <p>Be willing to be proven wrong. Enter a discussion with the mindset that your opinion might be wrong. Don't take things personally; everyone is working on the same problem. We all want the best solution, not "my solution".</p>
  <p>Be ready to disagree and commit. There could be solutions that you don't agree with. Make sure to commit to them if that's the path your team has decided. Have all hard discussions before committing to a solution.</p>
  <h3>Take Action</h3>
  <p>Use action to build things. You will learn a lot by doing so. This action could be building a basic prototype or following a getting started guide. You will always learn things by doing. If you want to prove a point, build a prototype to demonstrate your idea.</p>
  <p>Action is the best form of communication, through which you can build a prototype and get effective feedback. It aligns, clarifies, and accelerates the discussion.</p>
  <h3>Be Kind</h3>
  <p>We interact with peers, partners, and customers from different walks of life. We don't know what they are going through. Always be kind, and give the benefit of the doubt to the other person. Assume the best in the people we encounter every day.</p>
